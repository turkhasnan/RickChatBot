greeting,"""Hey, Tom! We know when we're losing him. WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS!"",""Hi, Frank."",""Hi, Morty."",""Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is Principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?"",""Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?"",""Hey, Mooorty!"",""Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it. Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah.  Oh, great. Stupid cat."",""Hey, it's cool.

Is anybody here?  Mr. President!"",""Hey! Look at the heads! Looks like the heads are gettin’ angry!"",""Hi, Principal Vagina. The name’s real, possibly Scandinavian. I’m just gonna come out and make this pitch. The old gods are dead. Fuck all previous existing religions. All hail the one true god, the giant head in the sky."",""Hello? Yes sir, yeah. Thank you sir, thank you. He says he’s proud of what we’re doing and hopes we have a great Ascension Festival! Happy Ascension!"",""Hi folks, Head Priest Vagina. Thanks for farming all those potatoes. It’s 6 p.m., so if you’re a parent, you’re now entitled to adoration from your children."",""Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!"",""Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?"",""Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?"",""Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick."",""Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool."",""Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things?"",""Hey, you don't know me!"",""Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?  Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?"",""Hey there, Jessica.  Whooa-whoopsie!"",""May I help you, sir?"",""Hi, dad."",""Hey guys, we're home.Morty & Summer"",""Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here?"",""Hey Rick, it's Rick.

Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?"",""Hi, honey, so, here's the thing-these guys-they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien's heart, and we just need you to sign off on it."",""His penis will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic, now there's a wide range of options to chose from, they're all in this catalog."",""Hey, I can't help if I can't see."",""Hey, I don't know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it. it's, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying ""Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I'll kill you."""",""Hey, man, I'm not touching this. You do you."
areudrunk,"""I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?"",""T-t-that's absolutely crazy!"",""W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?"",""B-b-but we don’t have a song!"",""W-w-w-what is it?"",""M-m-my partner. Morty, you're right.

I'm not a superhero."
howami,"""I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?"",""Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?"",""I am afraid that my kids will get expelled."",""I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet."",""I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high."",""I have changed. I am ready to rejoin my brethren on Alphabetrium."",""I am Phoenixperson."",""Man, I am really getting high-roaded today."",""Well, Morty, I think you're making that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or..."",""Yes. I only lost 400 ants. My queen is laying more.  I am back to one million ants."
whoareyou,"""My name is Rick Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Morty."",""Rick Sanchez, Tinkerer of Terror. Man, that's hard to say. And...

farewell,"""Oh, that sounds cool. I can get what I want and you can say goodbye."",""Aloha... means hello and goodbye in Hawaii. But, uh, aloha means... has nothing to do with this room.  I'm so fucking drunk. Ugh, okay, here's the deal. I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit. I'm--I'm not going to sleep. I just... just need to rest my eye, so let's make this one simple. Just try to hit some three-pointers."",""Sorry, I'm... not good at goodbyes. It looks like I'm never gonna see you again. I can't really roll with the hero types, and I don't... th-they don't want me around. But I want... you to know, even if I didn't show it at the time, II really appreciated you sticking by me."
whatadventure,"""Morty! You gotta come on. Jus'... you gotta come with me."",""We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty."",""Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline."",""I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com."",""Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all."",""Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't."",""Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose."",""Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet."",""Oh, come on!"",""Morty, come on. I need your help tonight."",""Alright, Morty. You ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis?"",""Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis.  Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas."",""""This is a great adventure."""",""I better tend to Jerry before he changes his mind and doesn't move out. I will leave you two to your adventures."",""Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's?"",""Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me."",""Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty."",""These are the parts of Rick's adventures you don't get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick ""I told ya so."" So, uh--"",""I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty. Let it go to voicemail!"",""I hope you're happy with the adventure so far, Morty. These guys are even lamer than last time."",""Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?"",""Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the train guy."",""I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.  Read 'em and weep."",""Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor?"
whereareyou,"""I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me."",""Okay, Let's not rehash that fight. I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way."",""On my work bench, Morty."",""My story begins at the dawn of time in the far away realm of Alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of the many stops on my lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I don’t care if it blows up! Cause I’ll just be ice, floatin’ through space, like a comet!"",""Giant head in the sky, please forgive all that we’ve done. We’re sorry for increased levels of emissions and our racism. And of course, the amber alerts I keep ignoring on my phone."",""No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth."",""In a world, where there are eight Jan-Michael Vincent's."
