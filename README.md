# RickChatBot
A Project Utilizing LSTM Cells and a Recurrent Neural Network
--

What's up! If you're a Rick and Morty fan, this might be a fun project to try out. 
I did have a lot of personal bugs regarding my environment and versions of libraries, but still try it.

This is a chatbot with a personality of Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty. 
You can go through the Jupyter Notebook file to for a 'detailed' walk-thru of my experience.

### BUTT

Let me just explain what each file is:

RickandMortyScripts.csv - the ORIGINAL data set that I received on Kaggle
RickandMortyChatBot.ipynb - actual project
content.json - JSON file containing the possible user inputs, responses from Rick, and the tag associated with the responses
rick_responses.csv - QUERIED data set
rick_responses_query - the SQL query used to create the rick_responses.csv (this honestly could have been better. if you have feedback, please let me know)


IF YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK REGARDING ANY OF THE CODE, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO MESSAGE ME ON LINKEDIN
